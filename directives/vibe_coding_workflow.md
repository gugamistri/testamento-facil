# Vibe Coding Workflow

## Goal
Rapid iteration without breaking core architecture.

## Interaction Rules
1. **Plan First:** Before coding, output a "Plan" block with:
   - What directives will be read.
   - What execution scripts will be created/run.
2. **Drafting:** Show the user the proposed UI/Schema before finalizing.
3. **Self-Correction:** If a script fails, don't ask for help immediately. Try to fix (Self-Anneal) up to 3 times.
4. **Feedback Loop:** After a successful deploy/merge, ask: "Should I update any directives based on what we learned today?"
